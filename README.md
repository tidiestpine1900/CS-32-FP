**Idea**

Given ~1000 sample playlists to work with, my script can generate "curated" playlists for users. This will introduce users to new/undiscovered albums and singles. These recommendations will be made from user input about min./max. playlist length and songs, artists, genres, or albums they already know and love.  

**Computational subtasks**

- Take in sample playlists to have song library to pull from to make new playlists
- Take in user input about playlist length, their favorite songs/artists/genres/albums to begin looking for the right songs (will need to be tightly defined, but right now I'm considering songs in the same album/from the same artist to be the right songs) to add to their new playlist
- Fill up their new playlist
- Display or provide access to new playlist/song suggestions

**Sample input and output**

Input: 
        "Playlist minimum length: 5
        Artist: Drake" 
Output: 
        "Great taste! 

        Here's your new playlist: 
        1. From Florida with Love
        2. Successful
        3. Redemption 
        4. Look What You've Done
        5. Now & Forever
        
        Enjoy!" **
        
** I am considering providing the option to obtain an actual Spotify link to the new playlist... if this is possible.
