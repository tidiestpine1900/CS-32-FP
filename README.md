**Idea**

Find more music that is similar to my own taste, but introduces me to new/undiscovered albums and singles. Maybe I can generate these new playlists by different components that I’d like to find similar sounds with – beats, melody, artist, popularity, year. 

**Computational subtasks**

- Gain access to user’s Spotify records 
- Come up with/access music-matching or music-discovering algorithm
- Display or provide access to new song suggestions
