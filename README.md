**Project purpose**

Given 5 sets of 1,000 sample playlists to work with, my script can generate "curated" playlists for users. My program is called the "Playlist _Producer_", and it introduces users to new/undiscovered songs. These recommendations are made using user input about playlist length, playlist composition, and their favorite artist.  

**Computational subtasks**

- Take in sample playlists to have song library to pull from to make new playlists
- Take in user input about playlist length, their favorite artist to begin looking for the right songs (songs from the same artist) to add to their new playlist
- Fill up their new playlist with familiar songs
- Populate remainder of the playlist with related songs, my suggestions. These are songs from the playlists that contain their favorite artist, but are from new artists.
- Display new playlist and song suggestions, with artist credits.

**Next steps**

To continue developing this project, I would provide the option to obtain an actual Spotify link to the new playlist. Another feature I'd love to explore is making the playlist based on favorite album or genre, which would require a drastic change in or addition to my algorithm. Lastly, I would also make my program more error-proof, as it takes in a considerable amount of user input that has to be accounted for.
